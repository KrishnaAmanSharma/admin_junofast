# Supabase Database Setup Guide

## Step 1: Configure Database Connection

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects)
2. Select your project
3. Click "Connect" in the top toolbar
4. Under "Connection string" â†’ "Transaction pooler", copy the URI
5. Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with your actual database password
6. Update the DATABASE_URL secret in your Replit environment

## Step 2: Database Schema Setup

Your Supabase database should already have the following tables created based on your schema:

- `service_types` - Service categories (House, Office, Vehicle, etc.)
- `profiles` - User profiles linked to auth.users
- `orders` - Customer orders with pickup/drop locations
- `common_items` - Predefined items for each service type
- `service_questions` - Dynamic questionnaire system
- `common_items_in_orders` - Items selected in orders
- `custom_items` - Custom items added by customers
- `order_question_answers` - Customer responses to service questions
- `item_photos` - Photos of custom items
- `order_details` - Additional order metadata

## Step 3: Sample Data Setup

Once connected, run the setup script to populate your database with sample data:

```bash
node setup-sample-data.js
```

## Step 4: Switch to Production Database

After DATABASE_URL is configured, update `server/storage.ts`:

```typescript
// Change this line:
export const storage = new MockStorage();

// To this:
export const storage = new PostgresStorage();
```
