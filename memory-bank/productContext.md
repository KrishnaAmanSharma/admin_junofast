# Product Context: Relo Admin Dashboard

## Why This Project Exists

### Business Problem
The Juno Fast relocation platform needed a centralized administrative interface to manage the complex workflow between customers, vendors, and internal operations. Without proper admin tools, the business faced:

- Manual order processing and vendor coordination
- Lack of visibility into platform operations
- Difficulty managing vendor approvals and performance
- Inefficient handling of customer support issues
- No centralized system for service configuration

### Solution Approach
The Relo Admin Dashboard provides a comprehensive web-based interface that centralizes all administrative functions, enabling efficient platform management and operational oversight.

## How It Should Work

### Core User Workflows

#### 1. Order Management Workflow
```
New Order → Admin Review → Vendor Broadcast → Vendor Response → Order Assignment → Status Tracking → Completion
```

**Admin Actions:**
- Review incoming orders for completeness
- Set appropriate pricing based on order details
- Broadcast orders to qualified vendors
- Review vendor responses and price updates
- Assign orders to selected vendors
- Monitor order progress through completion

#### 2. Vendor Management Workflow
```
Vendor Application → Admin Review → Approval/Rejection → Performance Monitoring → Rating Management
```

**Admin Actions:**
- Review vendor applications and documentation
- Approve or reject vendor registrations
- Monitor vendor performance metrics
- Handle vendor disputes and issues
- Manage vendor ratings and feedback

#### 3. Service Configuration Workflow
```
Service Type Creation → Common Items Setup → Question Configuration → Testing → Activation
```

**Admin Actions:**
- Define new service types (e.g., "House Relocation", "Office Moving")
- Configure common items for each service type
- Set up service-specific questions for customers
- Test configurations before going live
